      <h2>Thanks for applying!</h2>
      <p>We're excited that you're interested in joining the team! At Radius, you will be performing a wide variety of frontend tasks. To supplement your interview, <strong>we've created these tasks</strong> around <a href="exercises/001/index.html">Foodie Underground</a>, a fake foodie blog about Austin cuisine!</p>
      <h2>What to do?</h2>
      <p>Here is what you'll be doing for each task</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read the instructions</li>
        <li>Modify the CSS, HTML and/or JavaScript</li>
        <li>In making changes, keep notes of your thought process, we will like to hear about it</li>
        <li>Save your work</li>
        <li>Share your work by pushing to Github (or by emailing <a href="mailto:design@radius.com">us</a>).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>There aren't any wrong answers</h3>
      <p>We understand in a real-world situation, there can be external factors impacting how something is done.</p>

      <!--<p>Fork the problem set <a href="#">here</a> into your GitHub account. For each exercise, edit the files needed to make the changes. Once completed, push your changes up to Github and <a href="#">send us</a> the URL of your fork.</p>-->
      <h3>Task 1</h3>
      <p>You've been tasked to add a photo to the <a href="exercises/001/index.html">blog page</a>. The mockup is <a href="#">here</a>. The photo is in this <a href="#">zip file</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Hey! I just sent over a mockup. Let me know any questions! We're just wanting to put some photos on the blog. 
        <span>Thanks</span>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Task 2</h3>
      <p>The neighborhood association put up <a href="exercises/002/index.html">a page</a> about their picnic this year. The designer doesn't have a lot of CSS knowledge and wants you to know your thoughts about <a href="exercises/002/style.css">his CSS</a>. Can you refactor the stylesheet a little? Use comments to indicate your changes so the designer knows what's different.</p>
      <h3>Task 3</h3>
      <p>[not written]</p>
