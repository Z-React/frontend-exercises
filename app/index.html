      <h2>Thanks for applying!</h2>
      <p>We're excited that you're interested in joining the team! At Radius, you will be performing a wide variety of frontend and interaction tasks. To supplement your interview, <strong>we've created these tasks</strong> around <a href="tasks-ours-incomplete/001/index.html">Foodie Underground</a>, a fake foodie blog about Austin cuisine!</p>
      <h2>What to do?</h2>
      <p>Here is what you'll be doing for each task</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read the instructions</li>
        <li>Modify the CSS, HTML and/or JavaScript in folder <a href="tasks-yours-complete/">tasks-yours-complete</a> (find original copies of tasks in <b>tasks-ours-incomplete</b>).</li>
        <li>In making changes, consider keeping notes of your thought process as this will likely be discussed in future phases of the interview process.</li>
        <li>Save your work to the respective task folder within <a href="tasks-yours-complete/">tasks-yours-complete</a>.</li>
        <li>Share your work by pushing to Github (or by emailing your contact).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are no wrong answers.</p>
      <p>We understand in a real-world situation, there will be external factors impacting how things are marked up.</p>
      <h3>Task one</h3>
      <p>You've been tasked to add a photo to the <a href="tasks-ours-incomplete/001/index.html">blog page</a>. The mockup is <a href="images/mockup-images.png">here</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Hey! I just sent over a mockup. Can we put some photos on the blog similar to the mockup? Please let me know any questions. Thank.

      </ul>
      <h3>Task two</h3>
      <p>The neighborhood association put up <a href="tasks-ours-incomplete/002/index.html">a page</a> about their picnic this year. The designer doesn't have a lot of CSS knowledge and wants to know your thoughts about <a href="tasks-ours-incomplete/002/style.css">this CSS</a>. Can you <em>refactor and optimize</em> their CSS (and HTML, if you need to)? Use comments to indicate your changes so the designer knows what's different.</p>
      <h3>Task three</h3>
      <p>The Foodie Underground blog needs a gallery page. The task is detailed in this email you receive:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Hi, we need a new gallery page. We are thinking make it look like the <a href="tasks-ours-incomplete/003/index.html">homepage</a> but with an image gallery with the attached images. We want to keep the right column.
        <span>Thanks</span>
