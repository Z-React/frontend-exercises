Frontend challenge set
==================================

These are some small, hopefully enjoyable frontend challenges for you to complete at your leisure. There's no wrong way of completing these challenges.

### Getting started 

First, [fork](https://github.com/RadiusIntelligence/frontend-exercises/fork) this repo. If you need any help, Github has a nice [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

Once forked, clone your fork to your local machine. 

### Performing the interview tasks 

Find and open `app/index.html` in your browser. Follow the directions from there. 

> If you prefer [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), you can run 'gulp watch' from the command line and work that way, too. If you don't have gulp installed, don't worry about it. It's a bit much to explain here and not strictly needed.

### When you are finished 

When you have the tasks completed to your satisfaction, save your work and push to Github. Share the URL of your private fork with your contact at Radius. You'll hear from us soon with the next steps!

### Tips ###

1. Complete only the tasks you feel comfortable with. We're not expecting perfection.
2. If helpful, make notes on your thought process. It will be interesting to discuss this in your next interview
3. *advanced* If you prefer a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) workflow, you can run `gulp watch` from the command line for gulp-y benefits. This will require all of the needed libraries to be installed.

### Questions? ###

Please reach out to [Edbury](edbury@radius.com) or [Sam](sam@radius.com) with any questions.

Happy coding!
